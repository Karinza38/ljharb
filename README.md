Hiâ€¼ My name's [Jordan](https://twitter.com/ljharb), and I've gradually mutated over the last decade into being super obsessed with open source, backwards compatibility, and finding ways to balance what I feel are ethical obligations to *all* users of projects I interact with, with the very real problem of time management, burnout, and work/life balance.

I've been a part of TC39 (the committee that writes the specification for JavaScript) since 2014, and I was an editor of the specification from 2018-2021. I've been heavily involved in the node community for as many years, and I've gradually created (but mostly inherited or been gifted) a decent number of open source projects. I persist in trying to maintain them all with maximal back compat, the strictest adherence to semver, and the greatest respect for users.

# How Sponsorship Helps

Although open source is a huge part of my life, it's not the most important part - I have a spouse, kids, and a dog; bills to pay; and I also try to give back to the wider community.

Sponsorship helps fund domains, travel, but also *other sponsorships*
